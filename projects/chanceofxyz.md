## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
ChanceOf.xyz creates Data 'Legos' that help people know the chances of something happening before they transact. Based on the pioneering work of Dr. Sam Savage, ChanceOf.xyz uses the SIPmath specificaion for communicating uncertainties as actionable data. Chance-data is shared via IPFS as a public untilty. 
## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->
IPFS plays important role in ChanceOf.xyz as the proabilty libraries are loaded and fetched from IPFS.

## Project Status
<!--brainstorming, fundraising, under development, beta, shipped, etc-->
The project was created by a team of strangers in four weeks. We came together somewhat randomly during team formation at ETH Global hackathon and created a chance of DeFi loan liquidating dApp (prototype). The probability data is stored and retrieved from IPFS. We would like to continue to project and make chance-data a public utility.

## Previews
<!--Add some screenshots to give a preview of your product-->
https://strangers-united.kitlung.com/#/
You will need to connect a crytpo wallet to see the demo. We do not retrieve any information from your wallet as this is just a demo.

## Target Audience
<!--Describe who will be your project's users-->
We started off with DeFi data but have plans to put covid-19 transmision probabilies, sport/gaming, rare event data and more.

## Rough estimated user base (if applicable)
Currently it's under development

## How to Contribute
<!--How can the community contribute to your project?-->
We are looking for contributors that have historical data sets or predictive models to 'bottle' their outputs in SIPMath format. As well app developers that specialize in data viz. Our plan is to create a searchable index of IPFS based chance-data. We believe measuring uncertinty and sharing it in an auditable and additive way will be more important for permissionless networks.
